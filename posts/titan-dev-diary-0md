## Background
Titan(1980) is a fun board game with significant flaws.  
Some flaws charming, some unwieldly.  
With digital aid and a cardboard focus, Titan can rise above.  
Making army movement easier,only marker will need on-board presence,  
distributing public army information, and doing bookeeping will be the main benefits.
Additional benefits will be preserving game state easier since Titan can last 
upwards of 4 hours, takes significant table real estate, and relocating is tenous at best.


## Day -1
I made some false starts since my original vision was for a phone app.  
Phones take up minimal table space, people typically have one handy etc.  
However I've never made a phone app, and the despair of starting from scratch
on a technical level with a project of this ambition swallowed me whole whenever I ventured  
into Android Studio. I decided to lower the barrier by making a desktop app in Python:  
logic, organization, and technical ability of Python itself  would be familiar, 
leaving the GUI and network as a learning curve. I like to use projects to learn new things, 
while refining existing skills, and lately Python's lacked eligible suitors: most things falling 
well within my threshold. A skill atrophying because it makes things **too** easy.  

## Day 0
I started with a Google query along the lines of "Game Session with Python".  
I'd never done GUI or network programming with Python; I was on familiar ground syntax-wise, but these libraries I'd never touched.  
I didn't even know Python had an in-built GUI library called `tkinter`.  
Using the blog post linked below as a guide, I did an ad hoc learn/remix session:  
* skim post, mainly looking at code
* copy code via manually typing it out changing things as needed
* a lot of start-stop-read-repeat going on.
* stubbing out things in the form of empty functions, file names, and comments.  

End result: Client/Server code in the Blog post written out, a skeleton of directories and functions that would guide me on the morrow.  
Finally, a start. This was about as far as I had gotten on the phone app version, but in a couple hours as opposed to days.  
as opposed to multiple sessions over multiple days. Plus I managed to do it off of one post, since my abilities to evaluate Python resources is much higher  
then for Android Studio.
